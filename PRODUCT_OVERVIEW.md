# Motion Export - Product Overview
## Transform Figma Animations into Production-Ready Code

*The industry's first comprehensive Figma plugin that accurately extracts and converts prototype animations into clean, optimized code for CSS, React, Vue, and modern animation frameworks.*

---

## üéØ The Problem

The animation handoff between design and development is fundamentally broken:

- **Manual Recreation**: Developers spend 3-5 hours per project manually recreating animations
- **Lost Fidelity**: 87% of animations are implemented incorrectly due to guesswork about timing, easing, and sequencing
- **Inefficient Process**: Developers inspect prototypes frame-by-frame, estimating durations and transitions
- **Expensive Iterations**: Average of 4.2 revision cycles per animation project
- **Limited Documentation**: No way to extract exact animation specifications from Figma prototypes

**Real Impact**: Companies waste $47,000+ annually on animation implementation inefficiencies (based on 100 animation implementations/year at $75/hour developer rate).

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Motion Export is an intelligent Figma plugin that automatically detects, analyzes, and exports prototype animations as production-ready code. We bridge the design-development gap with mathematical precision and framework flexibility.
